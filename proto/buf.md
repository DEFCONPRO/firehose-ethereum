### StreamingFast Firehose Ethereum Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose Ethereum chain(s) like Ethereum Mainnet, BSC, Polygon and more.

Foremost, this provides [sf.ethereum.types.v2.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-ethereum/docs/main:sf.ethereum.type.v2#sf.ethereum.type.v2.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams Ethereum block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
