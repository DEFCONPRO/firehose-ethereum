      --common-blocks-cache-dir string                              [COMMON] Blocks cache directory where all the block's bytes will be cached to disk instead of being kept in RAM. This should be a disk that persists across restarts of the Firehose component to reduce the the strain on the disk when restarting and streams reconnects. The size of disk must at least big (with a 10%!b(MISSING)uffer) in bytes as the sum of flags' value for  'common-blocks-cache-max-recent-entry-bytes' and 'common-blocks-cache-max-entry-by-age-bytes'.

      --common-blocks-cache-enabled                                 [COMMON] Use a disk cache to store the blocks data to disk and instead of keeping it in RAM. By enabling this, block's Protobuf content, in bytes, is kept on file system instead of RAM. This is done as soon the block is downloaded from storage. This is a tradeoff between RAM and Disk, if you are going to serve only a handful of concurrent requests, it's suggested to keep is disabled, if you encounter heavy RAM consumption issue, specially by the firehose component, it's definitely a good idea to enable it and configure it properly through the other 'common-blocks-cache-...' flags. The cache is split in two portions, one keeping N total bytes of blocks of the most recently used blocks and the other one keeping the N earliest blocks as requested by the various consumers of the cache.
